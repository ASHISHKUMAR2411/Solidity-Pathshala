# Check Palindrome

This is a code that checks whether the digits of the number forms a Palindrome or not.

Here we have created a function **_palindrome_** which takes in a number as an input parameter.
It then reverses the number and checks if the original number is equal to the reversed number or not and returns the results accordingly.
