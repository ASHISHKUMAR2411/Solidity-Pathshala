# Inheritance 
Inheritance in the Solidity is the procedure in which one contract inherits the attributes and methods of another contract. Following are the key highlights.

- A derived contract can access all non-private members including internal methods and state variables. But using this is not allowed.

- Function overriding is allowed provided function signature remains same. In case of difference of output parameters, compilation will fail.

#### Now we will see inheritance with the help of an example using remixIDE:-

1) We have the Parent contract in which we have added some functions and variables.
